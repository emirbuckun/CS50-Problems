        <h2 class="text-danger">How Did I Start?</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">When I was in the 7th grade, one of my physical education teacher took me to school volleyball team as a setter.
        We train very well with team. I liked playing volleyball for the first time in this team.</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">After Secondary School</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">I was not a chatty person in high school. When I was first grader, I always play volleyball at the schoolyard.
        Then, a physical education teacher saw me while playing volleyball. He invited me to school volleyball team as a hitter and I accepted. In this way,
        a 4-year period started.</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">All Positions - One Person</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">As I mentioned above, first, I played as a setter at secondary school. Then, I played as a hitter at first grade in high school.
        Last of all, my defense was good and we had good spikers. Because of this situation, I also played as a libero in high school volleyball team.</p>
