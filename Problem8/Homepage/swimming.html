        <h2 class="text-danger">How Did I Start?</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">Everything about swimming started with an idea from my dad when I'm 10 years old. He said he could send me to a swimming course.
        I accepted directly and went there for a month. I learned freestyle swimming there.</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">After The Course</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">We moved to a site that have a pool. I always tried to improve myself in swimming as in other sports branches.</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">Learning Different Swimming Styles</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">I started learning new styles like butterfly after developing myself in freestyle swimming.</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">The Awareness</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">After learning swimming styles and developing myself in these styles, I realize that I should use this effort somewhere.
        Then I heard about some races namely Samsung Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swimming Race and Çanakkale Cross-Continental Swimming Race.
        Now I'm getting ready from morning till evening during summer and winter for these races. I can't wait to swim in these competitions</p>
